## üöÄ Model Enhancements (10/27/2025)

Recent updates have significantly improved the performance and interpretability of the fraud detection system:

- **Upgraded Model:** Replaced Logistic Regression with **LightGBM (LGBMClassifier)** to better handle class imbalance and achieve higher accuracy.
- **Enhanced Evaluation:** Integrated **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** metrics for a more comprehensive understanding of model performance on minority (fraud) cases.
- **AUC-ROC Curve:** Added an **AUC-ROC Curve** visualization to graphically evaluate the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
- **Improved Reliability:** Leveraged LightGBM‚Äôs gradient boosting framework for improved precision, recall stability, and faster model convergence compared to linear models.
- I previously lost my improvements due to git command mishandling and removed my whole repository and now I have fixed everything, work needs to be finished you know ;)
